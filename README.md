Hi, I'm Michael! I make cool software in a number of languages. If you've found
me here organically, you're probably looking for some of my work surrounding
Neovim. Here's a little bit about me:

- I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of experience in the frontend (modern
  TypeScript, JavaScript, React) and backend (primarily industrial C++, Python,
  Node.js, and OCaml).
- I'm an active open-source contributor, with a focus on Neovim plugins,
  quality-of-life tools, and the «functional programming» paradigm.
- I'm a computer science student, with research interests in distributed
  systems, programming language theory, compiler design, and formal methods.
- And just for fun, I also appreciate and study: analytic philosophy, poker
  theory, cryptic (i.e., British-style) crosswords, and electric guitar.
